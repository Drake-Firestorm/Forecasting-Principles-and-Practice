#* 6 ----
# Are the following statements true or false?
# Explain your answer.

#** 6.a ----
# Good forecast methods should have normally distributed residuals.

#   False, normally distributed residuals make calculating prediction intervals easier. However, they do not neccessarily improve the forecast itself.


#** 6.b ---- 
# A model with small residuals will give good forecasts.

#   False, residuals are the difference between fitted and actual values. They are based on the train data. So overfitted models give small residuals but the forecast might be bad.


#** 6.c ----
# The best measure of forecast accuracy is MAPE.

#   False, MAPE is a good measure but not the best. It has issues like
#     - assumes data has an absolute zero
#     - heavier penalty for negative zeros than positive
#     - is infinite/very high if the actual value is equal or close to 0


#** 6.d ----
# If your model doesnât forecast well, you should make it more complicated.

#   True, if forecasts are not good might need to perform transformations on the data or using more complicated models.


#** 6.e ----
# Always choose the model with the best forecast accuracy as measured on the test set.

#   True, however, there is a possibility that the best model can be further improved.
